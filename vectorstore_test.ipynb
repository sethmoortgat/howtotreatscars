      "Burn scars are usually inevitable when the dermis is damaged and without surgery the wound takes up to three weeks or longer to heal. Although split skin grafts reduce healing times and scarring, they still leave a scar. Even with excellent treatment a scar may be present once the wound has healed. Although scarring can be minimized or improved by various non-invasive, semi-invasive treatments and surgical procedures the scar can’t completely be eliminated. Burn scars are often characterized by hypertrophy, contraction and an uneven texture. Treatment options for burn scars include home treatments like pressure therapy, silicone, topicals, etc., non-invasive treatments performed by scar specialists, minimally invasive treatments which have become increasingly popular due to highly visible results and short recuperation times, and surgery. Reconstructive surgery is often seen as the last option after all other treatment options have failed, but with burn scars, it is often a necessary measure.\n",
