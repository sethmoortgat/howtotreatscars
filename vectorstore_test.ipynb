      "Why Surgical Scar Revision?\n",
      "\n",
      "Annually, 200 million incisions (surgical cuts) are performed worldwide. The treatment of aesthetically unacceptable scars can be challenging, although several options are available. These options vary from non-invasive options to invasive scar revision. As there are lots of options along this spectrum it is important that you seek advice for your specific concerns from a surgeon specialised in scar.\n",
      "Patients often see a plastic surgeon once they have tried lots of other non-invasive options. However, sometimes there are non-invasive options that could be more appropriate than surgery; again, an assessment by your scar specialist is important.\n",
      "While various surgical options exist, all surgery carries risk and therefore a full assessment is important so that you can let the surgeon know what your concerns are. The surgeon can explain all the possible procedures, the pros and cons of each one and what can or can’t be achieved with surgery. Sometimes more than one surgery will be needed and follow up after surgery is also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timing\n",
      "\n",
      "The timing of surgical scar revision is important. Immature scars are prone to hypertrophy and inflammation and can give poor results after scar revision. Non-invasive and/or semi-invasive treatments are often better during this period, also the natural healing process will still be underway. If you go ahead with surgery, it is best to stop smoking at a minimum from 4 weeks before surgery and until 4 weeks after surgery. Tobacco causes hypoxia (reduction of oxygen in the blood), vasoconstriction and decreased cell function and therefore it delays wound healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgical techniques of revising a scar\n",
      "\n",
      "Fusiform elliptical excision: the most appropriate technique to revise a mature depressed or spread scar which sits along the natural skin tension lines.\n",
      "Transposition flaps or Z-plasty: based on geometrical principles which change the direction of the scars to reduce tension; this is the most commonly used scar revision technique. The technique aligns the scar to the natural skin tension lines. There are many variations such as double opposing Z-plasty, Jumping Man plasty or W-plasty.\n",
      "Flap Surgery: Full thickness skin and tissue flaps can be used for revising large scars or scars that are in areas where it is difficult to mobilise the surrounding tissue.: are often used to cover larger skin defects when there is a vascular bed available \n",
      "Tissue expansion can be used for long linear scars or larger burn scars. A tissue expander (a liquid fillable inflatable ballon) is placed under the skin and is expanded gradually over a period of several months. Once there is enough expanded skin, the tissue expander can be removed, and the extra skin used for surgery to the nearby area.\n",
      "A dermal substitute or artificial skin is used when there is not enough healthy comparable skin available or if the wound is too deep. It can improve scars due to the regenerative potential of adipose stem cells. This technique is now often used with depressed or adhered scars.\n",

      "What are the potential risks and side effects of surgical scar revision?\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgical scar revision can carry several risks, including infection, bleeding, scarring, asymmetry, changes in skin sensitivity and color, and dissatisfaction with the aesthetic outcome. These risks can vary depending on the specific procedure performed, the individual characteristics of the patient, and the surgeon’s experience. It is essential to discuss these risks with a scar specialist and carefully weigh the pros and cons of the procedure before making a decision.\n",
      "How long does it take to see results after surgical scar revision?\n",
      "\n",
      "The time needed to see results after surgical scar revision can vary depending on several factors, including the specific procedure performed, the size and severity of the scar, and the individual’s healing capacity. Generally, initial results may be visible right after the surgery, but the final aesthetic outcome can take several months to a year to fully develop. Patience is important, as the healing process takes time and scars can continue to improve over time.\n",
      "How long does recovery take after surgical scar revision?\n",
      "\n",
      "The recovery process after surgical scar revision can vary depending on the complexity of the procedure, the location of the scar, and the individual’s healing capacity. Generally, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. In the initial days following the surgery, you might experience some discomfort, swelling, and bruising, which will gradually decrease as healing progresses. It is important to carefully follow the postoperative instructions provided by the surgeon, get adequate rest, and use any recommended medications to support the recovery process.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) is a highly effective and low risk laser for the treatment of a wide range of vascular lesions. PDL releases brief pulses of selectively absorbed optical radiation which can cause selective damage to pigmented structures (blood vessels) and cells. The PDL is used to treat port-wine stains, facial telangiectasias and haemangioma. Newer PDLs with longer wavelengths and extended pulse durations have made deeper tissue penetration possible and improved clinical outcomes with reduced risk. PDL treatments are performed with a topical anaesthetic.\n",

      "F.A.Q.\n",
      "Is Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) treatment suitable for all types of scars?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) is primarily suitable for scars with vascular components, such as those with redness or purple discoloration due to vascular lesions. It is effective for reducing scars caused by conditions like port-wine stains, small blood vessels on the face, and hemangiomas. However, for scars primarily characterized by other factors, such as texture changes or pigmentation, PDL may be less suitable.\n",
      "How many Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) sessions are usually needed for noticeable improvements in scars?\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of PDL sessions required for noticeable improvements in scars can vary depending on factors such as the severity and size of the scars, as well as the individual skin response to the treatment. Generally, multiple sessions are recommended, often ranging from 3 to 6 sessions, with intervals of 6 to 8 weeks between each session.\n",
      "What can I expect during and after PDL treatment for scars?\n",
      "\n",
      "During PDL treatment for scars, you can expect the skin to be locally numbed to minimize discomfort. The laser emits short pulses of light that are selectively absorbed by the blood vessels, which may cause a mild sensation of discomfort or warmth during the procedure. After the treatment, you might experience redness, swelling, and possibly a slight tingling sensation in the treated areas, but these side effects usually resolve within a few days to a week. It is important to follow your provider's aftercare instructions, such as avoiding direct sun exposure and using specific skincare products.\n",

      "Burn scars are usually inevitable when the dermis is damaged and without surgery the wound takes up to three weeks or longer to heal. Although split skin grafts reduce healing times and scarring, they still leave a scar. Even with excellent treatment a scar may be present once the wound has healed. Although scarring can be minimized or improved by various non-invasive, semi-invasive treatments and surgical procedures the scar can’t completely be eliminated. Burn scars are often characterized by hypertrophy, contraction and an uneven texture. Treatment options for burn scars include home treatments like pressure therapy, silicone, topicals, etc., non-invasive treatments performed by scar specialists, minimally invasive treatments which have become increasingly popular due to highly visible results and short recuperation times, and surgery. Reconstructive surgery is often seen as the last option after all other treatment options have failed, but with burn scars, it is often a necessary measure.\n",
